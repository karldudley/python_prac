No constants but if you name a variable in Capitals then you are telling others that it should be treated as a constant

You can name and assign multiple variables
e.g. a,b,c = 5, 3.2, 'Hello'

You can name and assign variables using input
e.g. favourite_fruit = input("What is your favourite fruit?")

number types - int, float, complex
string
boolean - e.g. print(10 > 9)

Use type() to find out the type
